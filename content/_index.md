- ## Who I Am
  I work at the intersection of public capital, venture strategy, and research — focused on how institutional design and financial instruments shape innovation in high-friction, public goods domains like space, climate, and education.

- ## What I Do
  Currently at the California State Treasurer's Office supporting public financing strategies. In parallel, I advise on early-stage aerospace and defense investments at New Vista Capital and conduct research at UC Berkeley.
