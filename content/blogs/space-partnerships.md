How can we design better institutional structures for space exploration? This post explores lessons from our PNAS research on avoiding coordination failures in the emerging space economy.

## The Challenge

As public and private institutions recognize the role of space exploration as a catalyst for economic growth, various areas of innovation are expected to emerge as drivers of the space economy.

## Key Insights

The current nature of space as an open-access resource and global commons presents a systemic risk for exuberant competition for space goods and services.

## Looking Forward

NASA, American research universities, and private companies can avoid any coordination failures by collaborating in a public–private research and development partnership (PPRDP) structure.
