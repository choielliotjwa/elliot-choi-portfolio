### Integrating Political-Economic Industrial Policy Design in Natural Resource Sectors

**Authors:** Gordon Rausser, William Foster, Elliot Choi  
**Journal:** *Annual Review of Resource Economics*, Vol. 17:127-147

The debate on industrial policies has long been polarized between proponents of government intervention and free-market advocates. This review proposes a new approach by extending the political-economic PEST-PERT portfolio framework to examine the efficacy of industrial policies in the agricultural, natural resource, and environmental sectors.

### Public–Private Partnerships in Fostering Outer Space Innovations

**Authors:** Gordon Rausser, Elliot Choi, Alexandre Bayen  
**Journal:** *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)*, Vol. 120(43), e2222013120  
**Citations:** 42

As public and private institutions recognize the role of space exploration as a catalyst for economic growth, various areas of innovation are expected to emerge as drivers of the space economy. These include space transportation, in-space manufacturing, bioproduction, in-space agriculture, nuclear launch, and propulsion systems, as well as satellite services and their maintenance. We present a public–private research and development partnership (PPRDP) structure to avoid coordination failures.

### Systematization of Knowledge: Synthetic Assets, Derivatives, and On-Chain Portfolio Management

**Authors:** Abrar Rahman, Victor Shi, Matthew Ding, Elliot Choi  
**Journal:** *arXiv preprint*, arXiv:2209.09958  
**Citations:** 10

Synthetic assets are decentralized finance (DeFi) analogues of derivatives in the traditional finance world. We present the first Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) in this area, focusing on presenting the key mechanisms, protocols, and issues in an accessible fashion to highlight risks for participants as well as areas of research interest.
